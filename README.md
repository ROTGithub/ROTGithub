- ROT is a Minecraft bedrock edition addon and it is used on probably 10-30 servers idk.

This user doesn't just include ROT, it includes other things that could be useful for ROT, plugins for ROT, and other shit most people don't care about.

## ROT
ROT is a Minecraft bedrock edition addon and it is used on probably 10-30 servers idk. It helps you create servers, and it is very useful, but I end up adding 10 unknown bugs trying to fix 1 bug. Don't worry about that, it's fine.

ROT is not entirely open source, but you can get some useful source code for making your own gametest addon, it will be pointless 98% of the time if you're not good at math because most features are already in ROT.

## Invisible Entity Addon
This addon adds invisible entities that you can use instead of armor stands when making commands. This also adds other useful entities that load chunks, their names are:
- trash:tickingarea1 (1 chunk radius)
- trash:tickingarea2 (2 chunk radius)
- trash:tickingarea3 (3 chunk radius)
- trash:tickingarea4 (4 chunk radius)
- trash:tickingarea5 (5 chunk radius)
- trash:tickingarea6 (6 chunk radius)

Theres also an invisible NPC that works like a normal npc, but invisible. Its name is: trash:invisible_npc

The invisible entities do nothing without commands, they are only useful for commands. The name for this entity is: trash:invisible_entity

Enjoy this random pile of shit!
